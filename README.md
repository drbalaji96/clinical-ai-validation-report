## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to produce a comprehensive, publication-quality validation report for an AI model, demonstrating a robust process for:
* Clinical Performance Assessment
* Algorithmic Bias and Fairness Auditing
* Lifecycle and Monitoring Planning

## Dataset

This analysis was performed on the **NIH Chest X-ray Dataset**, which contains over 100,000 anonymized chest x-ray images from more than 30,000 patients.

## How to Run This Project

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repo-url]
    ```
2.  **Set up the environment:**
    *(You will fill this in later with instructions on installing required Python libraries)*

## Results

A link to the final, consolidated **[Validation Dossier PDF](./reports/validation_report_final.pdf)** is available in the reports folder.
